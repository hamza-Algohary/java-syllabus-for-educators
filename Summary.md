## Day 1
### Printing
- Programs get executed sequentially.
- **Escape sequences** are sequences of charachters with special meaning:
    - `\n` (new line)
    - `\t` (tab)
- To print `"` or `\` you have to put a back-slash before it like so `\"` and `\\`

### Variables
- A **variable** is a place in memory. It stores data.
- Variables have types.
- Some types:
    - `int` (integer)
    - `double` (floating point number)
    - `boolean` (can only be true or false)
    - `char` (single charachter)
    - `String` (text)
- Variables can change.
- Variable Naming rules:
    - May only contain letters, numbers, `_`,`$`.
    - Can't start with a number.
- Variable names are case sensistive.
- Variable name can't be a reserved word.
- To make a variable unchangeable use `final`.

### Arithmetic Operators
- Java supports arithmetic operators `+` `-` `*` `/` `%`
- `%` is called modulus, it gets remainder of division.
- modulus only works with integers.
- Dividing two integers yields an integer. If you want a fraction, cast it to `double` or `float`.

### Assignment Operators
- Instead of writing `x = x + 5` you may write `x += 5`
- There also these operators `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=`
- `x++` means `x = x + 1`
- `x--` means `x = x - 1`

### Different datatypes have differnet sizes
Integral Types:
- `int` 4 bytes
- `long` 8 bytes
- `short` 2 bytes
- `byte` 1 byte

Fractional Types:
- `float` 4 bytes
- `double` 8 bytes

### Everything is a number
- Binary is a number system.
- Charachters are representable as numbers.
- True can be one and False can be zero.
- You can also represent colors as numbers.

# Day 2
### Getting user input
- Copy the following code.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // insert your code here

    }
}
```
- Replace the comment with your code.
- Some functions to get user input
    - `next()` (for String)
    - `nextInt()`
    - `nextDouble()`
    - `nextChar()` 
- Example:
    ```java
    int x = scanner.nextInt();
    ```

### Comparison operators
- `>`  greater than?
- `<`  less than?
- `>=` greater than or equal?
- `<=` less than or equal?
- `==` is equal?
- `!=` is not equal?
- Avoid comparing floating point numbers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `if` and `else` are used for decision making.<br>
> ```java
> if (condition) {
>     // do something
> } else {
>     // do another thing
> }
> ```

### Logical operators:
- `&&` (AND)
- `||` (OR)
- `!`  (NOT)


## Lecture 6

- A **class** is a custom type.
- An **object** is an instance of a class.
- A class has properties and behavior.
    - Properties are represented by variables
    - Behavior is represented by functions
-  Create a class, instantiate it and use it.
    - You can create it in the same file or another file
    - A file may only contain one public class
    - Exercise classes: Human, Animal, Car.
- **public** vs **private**
- **Getters** and **Setters**
- **this**
- A **constructor** is a function that runs when an object is created.
- Constructors can take arguments.
- Constructors can be overloaded.
- final
- static`
- Donâ€™t use uninitialized objects.

**Welcome to Software Development Foundations Program**

from **Az-SENCS**

---

## What is Az-SENCS?

---

**Software Development Foundations** program, is composed of 2 courses:
**1. Java Programming For Beginners.** (Hamza Algohary)
**2. Data Structures and Algorithms.** (Khaled Ekramy)

---

## Welcome to the Java Course.

---

The syllabus is available at:
https://github.com/hamza-Algohary/java-syllabus-for-educators

---

Essential tools you need to install:
1. Compiler
2. Text Editor

---

Usually these things are packed in a big program called an **IDE**

---

You can also use an online compiler. 

---

## Day 1
Today we're going to write **6 programs** and have **2 discussions**

---

## Program 1: Introduce Yourself.

---

Programs get executed sequentially.

---

## Program 2: Print a menu.

---

**Escape sequences** are sequences of charachters with special meaning:
    - `\n` (new line)
    - `\t` (tab)

---

To print `"` or `\` you have to put a back-slash before it like so `\"` and `\\`

--- 

## Program 3: Storing data.

---

A **variable** is a place in memory. It stores data.

---

Variables have types.

---

Some types:
    - `int` (integer)
    - `double` (floating point number)
    - `boolean` (can only be true or false)
    - `char` (single charachter)
    - `String` (text)

--- 

Variable Naming rules:
    - May only contain letters, numbers, `_`,`$`.
    - Can't start with a number.

---

Variable names are case sensistive.

---

Variable name can't be a reserved word.

--- 

Variables can change.

---

To make a variable unchangeable use `final`.

---

## Program 4: Calculate area of a rectangle.

---

### Arithmetic Operators

Java supports arithmetic operators `+` `-` `*` `/` `%`

---

## Program 5: Determine whether a number is even or odd.

---

`%` is called modulus, it gets remainder of division.

---

modulus only works with integers.

---

## Program 6: Divide two integers.

---

Dividing two integers yields an integer. If you want a fraction, cast it to `double` or `float`.

---



### Assignment Operators
Instead of writing `x = x + 5` you may write `x += 5`

--- 

### Assignment Operators
There also these operators `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=`

---

`x++` means `x = x + 1`

---

`x--` means `x = x - 1`

---

A **comment** is text neglected by the compiler

---

### Different data types have differnet sizes
Integral Types:
- `int` 4 bytes
- `long` 8 bytes
- `short` 2 bytes
- `byte` 1 byte

Fractional Types:
- `float` 4 bytes
- `double` 8 bytes


---

Everything is a number

---

Binary is a number system.

---

Charachters are representable as numbers.

---

True can be one and False can be zero.

---

You can also represent colors as numbers.

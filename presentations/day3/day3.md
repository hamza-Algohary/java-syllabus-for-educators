# Java Programming For Beginners
## Day 3

--- 

## Recap + Catcing on missing things

---

### Today we are going to learn loops.

---

## Program: Print "Hello World" 100 times.

---

## `while` is used to repeat code.
```java
while (conditon) {
    // do something.
}
```

---

## Program: Print from 0 to 100

---

## New term: Iteration

---

## Program: Print from 10 to 0

---

## Program: Print even numbers from 0 to 20

---

## Program: Check integer password until it's correct.

---

## Use `break` to stop a loop.

---

## There is also `do while`
```java
do {
    // do something.
} while (condition)
```

---

## `do while` checks the condition after first iteration.
So it will run at least once.

---

## There is also `for` loop
```java
for (start ; condition ; update) {
    // do someting
}
```

---

## Try redoing all the above programs using `for` loop

---

## Program: Print multiplication table of 2

---

## Program: Print multiplication table of numbers from 1 to 10

---

## You can put a loop inside a loop

---

## Research: continue;
